Shortcuts
--------------------------

This is for PC.  It's in C# & WPF.

You know when a new job comes in to the office and you write an email to those involved with all the links to the files on the server required to do the job.  This program is an alternative to that.  Same amount of work probably, but alternative nevertheless and it has the proper file icons and stuff

#####Instructions

You drag and drop the files from the server onto the area in the bottom (with the + symbol, see image below) and the shortcuts appear in the list.  You can then drag/drop to rearrange the items in the list

The default name (the bold font on each line) they're given is the filename, but you can change it by clicking on it and typing.  For instance the first file (image below) is called Trenham.xlsx but has been renamed to Job 112

After you have made a list you would then save it and send the file to your colleagues

You can then give this json file to whoever and as long as they also have access to the filepaths they can open the files/folders from this program
