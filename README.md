Shortcuts
--------------------------

This is for PC.  It's in C# & WPF.

You know when a new job comes in to the office and you write an email to those involved with all the links to the files on the server required to do the job.  This program is an alternative to that

You drag and drop the files from the server onto the area in the bottom (with the + symbol) and they appear in the list

You can then give this json file to whoever and as long as they also have access to the filepaths they can open the files/folders from this program
